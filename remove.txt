Remove Files
bash
rm filename                    # Remove a single file
rm file1 file2 file3          # Remove multiple files
rm *.txt                      # Remove all .txt files
rm -i filename                # Remove with confirmation prompt
rm -f filename                # Force remove (no prompts, ignore nonexistent files)

Remove Directories
bash
rmdir dirname                 # Remove empty directory only
rm -r dirname                 # Remove directory and all contents recursively
rm -rf dirname                # Force remove directory and contents (no prompts)
rm -ri dirname                # Remove recursively with confirmation for each file

Remove Everything in Current Directory
bashrm -rf *                      # Remove all files and folders (DANGEROUS!)
rm -rf .[^.]*                 # Remove all hidden files/folders
rm -rf * .[^.]*               # Remove everything including hidden files

Safety Tips
Always double-check your path before using rm -rf
Use ls first to see what you're about to delete
Consider using rm -i for interactive confirmation
The -f flag bypasses most safety prompts, so use carefully
There's no "trash" - deleted files are gone permanently

Examples
bash
rm document.txt               # Remove single file
rm -r old_project/           # Remove directory and contents
rm -f *.log                  # Force remove all log files
rm -rf /tmp/temp_folder/     # Remove temporary folder completely

Warning: Be extremely careful with rm -rf especially with wildcards or as root user, as it can permanently delete important system files.
